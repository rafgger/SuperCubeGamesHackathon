Goals: I want a flight from Paris to Rome on the 1.1.2026. --> Follow up question: Do you want to be told as well about what to see in Rome?

Future Development Suggestions: Swap this for Zep Memory or Upstash Redis. This allows users to return days later and say, "Book that flight we found last Tuesday."
